Project Etomology
=================
KJM Admin Notices doesn't seem to exist on GitHub, so posting here with intention of forking the code to support a different scope.  If possible, we'll remerge the projects.

* Renamed project  *"KJM Admin Notices Enhanced"* to avoid conflicts

As of 1/18', this fork is a work in progress (and you should not use this in production code). High praise goes to the project's original author.  That this
has been forked is not meant to disparage the orginal authors in any way, only that I honor their original work and
have not yet attempted to remerge the code.


Project Goals & Philosophy
=========================

Since 'Enhanced' fork...

* Over-arching goal
  * Communicate to Power Users
  * Assured, Timely, Easy to Create, Easy to Consume

* In-Scope:
    * Email, Web, In-Site... "Rich Broadcast", light two-way communication

* Out-of-Scope:
   * Rich help-desk support / Deep two-way communication

* Motivation (namely for the 'Enhanced' fork)
   *  As an administration of a multi-site web app, I want to
       * communicate to my power users
       * Give prospective clients/users evidence that this is not a dead project
       * Ease fricture in deploying new features (by communicating to key stakeholders)
       * Contribute to community 

* Plan of Attack 1/18'
    * Fork KJM Admin Notices into KJM Admin Notices Enhanced, post project goals
    * Bring in RSS-to-post code to generate notices (Test with some RSS-to-MailChimp functionality) 
    * Do, or document, method for consumers to access old posts
    * Refinements
        * Order posts by severity, then publish date
        * Limit audience to specific subset of roles
    * Contact original authors and attempt, if appropriated, re-merge the code

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
================================

= Installed plugin but I don't see how I can use it? =

Don't forget to go to 'Settings -> KJM Admin Notices' and activate both 'KJM Admin Notices' and 'Notice Post Type'. Once done, you will be able to add notices.

= Admin Notices don't get sent by email? =

First, make sure the 'Send Email' option is on. Same thing on your notice edit screen, make sure the 'Send Email' option is checked. Also make sure you checked relevant roles in ' Show Notice to Roles'. Lastly, you have to take in account that KJM Admin Notices only send email on publish of an existing post. The suggested way to do it is to first create a notice with 'Draft' state, then when tou are set, you just have to publish it to get the emails sent. You will see a big green button in the 'Sent' column which shows to how many people th notice has been sent.

= Why on publish, Admin Notices always get the 'Private' status? =

This is a built-in feature. At current state, KJM Admin Notices always set the status of a Notice to 'Private' on publish. It is to make sure only logged-in users can see notices and them comments, if 'Allow Comments' option is enabled. Future releases will have more options about it.

= How to use shortcodes? =
==========================

There are currently 3 different shortcodes available in KJM Admin Notices.

1. `[kjm_website_domain]` will be replaced with the base website domain name. Eg. 'domain.com'. Can be used in title and content.
1. `[kjm_display_name]` will be replaced with the user Display Name. Eg. 'John Doe'. Can be used in title and content.
1. `[kjm_admin_login]` will be replaced with the login URL to your website. Eg. 'http://domain.com/wp-login.php'. Can be used in content only.

= Are there some future improvements planned? =

* Add readmore management with JS in notices display. Eg : "Show More" toggle.
* Better management of send email option.
* Add an AJAX notes system on notices (different plugin?).
* Remove local-settings.php, or set it to be read from the theme first (this file is for setting local data mainly for developement or customization purposes).
